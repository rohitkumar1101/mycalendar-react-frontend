            <h4>
                Congratulations on turning 23. Growing old sucks and you are just starting out so you still have time. Enjoy as much as you can.
                The world has a lot to offer. Given that you are not the 17 year old clueless girl in a different country, you have grown up to be
                wonderful woman and I am simply proud of that.

            <h4>
                As you must know that i was clueless what to gift you. So when you do recieve the gift, atleast pretend to like it üòú
                Coming to the 4am conversation, I still did not complete it. So as we were not on talking terms I was talking with Anusha in order to
                plan a surprise for you on your special. I did not know if you would meet with me or not. So it took us a lot of time to plan even the
                most simplest of things because you know, we both kinda get carried away while talking about you üòù

            <h4>
                Not only a surprise, I even asked her about what would be a perfect gift for you but she was clueless like me. I thought of a lot of things
                that you might need. In the end, I remembered that you needed more space for your memories. <br /><br />

                <br />
                There you go. That's what I came up with. Hope you like it. Atleast now your memories will be safe and you'll have more space.
                That's such a dumb line. Anywayss, Happy Birthday once again ~ ‚ù§Ô∏è ~
