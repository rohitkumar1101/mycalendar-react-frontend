**Calendar -- My Tasks**

This is a simple application which allows the user to add tasks to calendar. It also provides functionality to Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) a Task.  

**Technical Choices**

**I. Frontend**

    1.  ReactJS -- A popular Front End library

    2.  React Hooks -- Helps in using state with Functional components

    3.  Full Calendar -- npm package which makes the rendering of the calendar easier

    4.  React DatePicker -- Helps the user to select a date from the calendar dropdown

    5.  React Router Dom -- Helps with the routing in the project

    6.  Bootstrap4 -- For the styling of the application

    7.  Netlify -- Static site generator which supports CI / CD

**II. Backend**

    1.  Django -- Helps to create the backend speedily

    2.  Python -- Language in which we write code in Django

    3.  Django Rest Framework -- Helps in making the Rest API

    4.  Django CORS Header -- Allows third parties to access the API

    5.  Heroku -- PaaS which allows to build, run and operate applications in the cloud
